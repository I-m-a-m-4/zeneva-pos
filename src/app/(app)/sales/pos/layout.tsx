          Offline data strategy for POS:
          1. On initial app load (online), fetch all product data from Firestore.
          2. Store this product data in a local persistent store (e.g., IndexedDB) for fast access and offline availability.
             - Include product ID, name, price, stock, SKU, image URL.
          3. The POS product selection page should primarily read from this local store.
          4. If online, periodically (or on demand) sync local product store with Firestore to get latest stock levels and prices.
          5. Transactions made while offline should be queued locally (e.g., in IndexedDB).
          6. When connection is restored, sync queued transactions to Firestore.
             - Handle potential conflicts (e.g., stock changes).
          7. On app refresh (if online), consider clearing and re-fetching local product data to ensure freshness.
